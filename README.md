# HeishamonMQTT
Simple plugin to manage Heishamon through MQTT


This [Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com/) plugin is able to read and to control the Panasonic using the [Heishamon](https://github.com/IgorYbema/HeishaMon) module.

# Prerequisites
To use Plugins in Domoticz please read : https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Using_Python_plugins

# Installation

1. Create a folder [HeishamonMQTT] in the plugin folder of domoticz
2. Restart domoticz
3. Add in the Hardware the Heishamon MQTT plug in.
4. All devices are created, add them from the devices

# Update :

1. place the (new) mqtt.py and plugin.py in the HeishamonMQTT folder (overwrite the old-files)
2. In Hardware, select the HeishamonMQTT plugin and click on Update 
   !!! Do NOT click on delete, all the devices will also be removed then !!!
3. Add new devices when needed

				, 4=Heat+DHW, 5=Cool+DHW, 6=Auto+DHW					not tested	
SetForceDHW			Forces DHW (Operating mode should be firstly set to one with DWH mode (3,4,5 or 6) to be effective. Please look at SET9 )	0, 1	not tested	
SetDHWTemp			Set DHW target temperature	40 - 75					not tested
SetForceDefrost			Forces defrost routine	0, 1						not tested	
SetForceSterilization		Forces DHW sterilization routine	0, 1				not tested	
SetZones                        Set zones to active  0 = zone 1 active, 1 = zone2 active, 2 = zone1 and zone2 active  tested                      
```

# ToDo:
- Check ForceDHW for correct operation mode
- Add influxDB support
- SetPump / SetPumpSpeed / SetCurves / SetFloorHeatDelta / SetFloorCoolDelta / SetDWHHeatDelta

# Common problems:
If you don't see the heishamon values in domoticz after enabling the plugin there are a few things you should check:
- Is heishamon receiving values from heatpump? (see heishamon webpage)
- Is heishamon correctly sending messages to mqtt broker? (see message in mqtt broker, for example with MQTT explorer)
- Is domoticz plugin correctly configured to point to the mqtt broker?
- Is 'allow new devices' enabled in domoticz?
- Do you have the most recent version of Heishamon firmware? (at least v1.0 is needed for plugin version 0.1.8 and up)
